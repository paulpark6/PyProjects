Flu medication for government employees

A specific vaccine for humans effective in preventing avian influenza is not yet
 readily available. Based on limited data, the CDC suggested that the anti-viral
  medication Oseltamivir (brand name-Tamiflu) may be effective in treating avian influenza. 
  Using this input, the Department of State decided to pre-position the drug Tamiflu at its 
  Embassies and Consulates worldwide, for eligible U.S. Government employees and their families 
  serving abroad who become ill with avian influenza.
